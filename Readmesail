Hello, this is Raensails. i am a transgender woman
learning to learn all over again lol! I have been in
transition becoming my authenticated self for the last
five years. Prior to this I was not someone that could
or would be found in the LGBTQIA community let alone
have association with anyone knowingly involved with
life outside of the facade of society's "straight" 
society lmao! I laugh at the joke is it truly is a
roos and in actaulity non existent yet life ebbs and 
flows inside this make believe idealism while 
constraining those who exist beyond. As is the case
for technology as it continually bursts outside the lines
of "what we think we know" vs what we THINK...we KNOW.
SO, with that I'm just say i hope to keep thinking
and i will learn all the is to know or most i can get
So that one day i might be a reason... that another 
just might be a student, be saved of..., inspired by
create the next, etc.etc etc. All in all, if I am
able to help develop with and thru technology life
and joy?  ill take it! thank you all of you've read my
ranting this far lol! ðŸ’• love.
